# 🌱 GreenSpark — Waste-to-Energy Facility Project Proposal

> “Turning Waste into Sustainable Energy”

---

## 📘 Overview

The **GreenSpark Waste-to-Energy Project** is an innovative initiative that aims to address two critical challenges in **Jericho, Palestine** — *waste management* and *energy generation*.  
By processing **1,200 tons of municipal solid waste per day**, the facility will generate **40 MW of renewable electricity**, helping reduce landfill accumulation, cut carbon emissions, and enhance local energy independence.

This project represents a cornerstone in sustainable development — combining **engineering, environmental responsibility, and economic growth**.
